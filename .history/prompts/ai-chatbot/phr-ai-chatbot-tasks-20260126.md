## Prompt

[No specific prompt provided - this was a /sp.tasks command that generates implementation tasks based on the feature specification and plan]

## Response snapshot

Created a comprehensive task breakdown for the AI Todo Chatbot implementation with 72 specific tasks organized across 7 phases. The tasks are organized by user stories in priority order, with clear dependencies and parallel execution opportunities identified. Each task follows the required checklist format with proper IDs, story labels, and file paths.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete task breakdown for AI Todo Chatbot implementation
- 🧪 Tests: N/A (tasks definition phase)
- 📁 Files: Created tasks.md with comprehensive implementation roadmap
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for implementation execution
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks organized by user stories with clear dependencies and parallel execution paths identified

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin executing tasks starting with Phase 1 setup tasks
